The human brain is a biologically inspired class of algorithms that process the information network of primitive computational elements. Deep learning is a useful technology to build a multilayer neural network architectures and their applications in a broad class of problems. Deep learning is used for speech recognition, image analysis, video analysis, and behavior prediction text processing machine translation. Used static data processing has several disadvantages, like high labor costs, for developing specialized data processing systems. The deep learning achieves low labor costs due to the algorithms' versatility, the ease of adaptation when you change the structure of the data, more data volume, and reliable data.
