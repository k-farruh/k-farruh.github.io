## Summary
**Container Number Recognition (CNR)** performs reading and identification of ISO 6346 container codes in logistic ports and handling cranes. The intelligent system allows us to manage several lanes from a single post and perform access control and efficient recognition, not only of the containers but also of the trucks in charge of their transportation.

## Technologies Used
- **Deep Learning**
- **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)**

## Key Features
- **Efficient Recognition**: High accuracy in identifying container codes.
- **Multi-Lane Management**: Capable of handling multiple lanes from a single control post.
- **Access Control**: Integrated with access control systems for enhanced security.
- **Truck Identification**: Recognizes not only containers but also the trucks transporting them.
