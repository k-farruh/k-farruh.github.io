### **GenAI Model Optimization: Guide to Fine-Tuning and Quantization**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*5ZX-IcnPKDnkTz6n)Artificial Intelligence has transcended from a buzzword to a vital tool in business and personal applications. As the AI field grows, so does the need for more efficient and task-specific models. This is where fine-tuning and quantization come into play, allowing us to refine pre-built models to suit our needs better and to do so more efficiently. Below is a guide designed to take beginners through the process of fine-tuning and quantizing a language model using Python and the Hugging Face `Transformers` library.

### The Importance of Fine-Tuning and Quantization in AI

Fine-tuning is akin to honing a broad skill set into a specialized one. A pre-trained language model might know a lot about many topics. Still, through fine-tuning, it can become an expert in a specific domain, such as legal jargon or medical terminology.

Quantization complements this by making these large models more resource-efficient, reducing the memory footprint, and speeding up computation. This is especially beneficial when deploying models on edge devices or in environments with limited computational power.

Businesses can leverage fine-tuned and quantized models to create advanced AI applications that weren't feasible due to resource constraints. These techniques also allow individuals to run sophisticated AI on standard hardware, making personal projects or research more accessible.

Before tackling the code, you'll need access to AI models and datasets. Hugging Face is the place to start:

1. Visit [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/).
2. Click "Sign Up" to make a new account.
3. Complete the registration process.
4. Verify your email, and you're all set!

Let's examine a real-world example of fine-tuning and quantization in action. You can find the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/k-farruh/Awesome-Qwen) or directly access the fine-tuning [script](https://github.com/k-farruh/Awesome-Qwen/blob/master/qwen-fine-tune.py).

### Preparing the Environment

First, the necessary libraries are imported. You'll need the `torch` library for PyTorch functionality and the `transformers` library from Hugging Face for model architectures and pre-trained weights. Other imports include `datasets` loading and handling datasets and `peft` and `trl` for efficient training routines and quantization support.


```
import torch  
from datasets import load\_dataset  
from transformers import (  
 AutoModelForCausalLM,  
 AutoTokenizer,  
 BitsAndBytesConfig,  
 TrainingArguments,  
 pipeline,  
 logging,  
)  
from peft import LoraConfig, PeftModel  
from trl import SFTTrainer
```
### Selecting the Model and Dataset

Next, the code specifies the model and dataset, which are crucial for fine-tuning. The `model_name` variable holds the identifier of the pre-trained model you wish to fine-tune and `dataset_name` is the identifier of the dataset you'll use for training.


```
model\_name = "Qwen/Qwen-7B-Chat"  
dataset\_name = "mlabonne/guanaco-llama2-1k"  
new\_model = "Qwen-7B-Chat-SFT"
```
### Fine-Tuning Parameters

Parameters for fine-tuning are set using `TrainingArguments`. This includes the number of epochs, batch size, learning rate, and more, determining how the model will learn during the fine-tuning process.


```
training\_arguments = TrainingArguments(  
 output\_dir="./results",  
 num\_train\_epochs=1,  
 per\_device\_train\_batch\_size=1,  
 gradient\_accumulation\_steps=1,  
 learning\_rate=2e-4,  
 weight\_decay=0.001,  
 # ... other arguments  
)
```
### Quantization with BitsAndBytes

The `BitsAndBytesConfig` configures the model for quantization. By setting `load_in_4bit` to `True`, you're enabling the model to use a 4-bit quantized version, reducing its size and potentially increasing speed.


```
bnb\_config = BitsAndBytesConfig(  
 load\_in\_4bit=use\_4bit,  
 bnb\_4bit\_quant\_type=bnb\_4bit\_quant\_type,  
 bnb\_4bit\_compute\_dtype=compute\_dtype,  
 bnb\_4bit\_use\_double\_quant=use\_nested\_quant,  
)
```
### Fine-Tuning and Training the Model

The model is loaded with the specified configuration, and the tokenizer is prepared. This `SFTTrainer` is then used to fine-tune the model on the loaded dataset. After training, the model is saved for future use.


```
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from\_pretrained(  
 model\_name,  
 quantization\_config=bnb\_config,  
 # ... other configurations  
)  
  
trainer = SFTTrainer(  
 model=model,  
 train\_dataset=dataset,  
 # ... other configurations  
)  
trainer.train()  
trainer.model.save\_pretrained(new\_model)
```
### Evaluating Your Model

With the model fine-tuned and quantized, you can now generate text based on prompts to see how well it performs. This is done using the `pipeline` function from `transformers`.


```
pipe = pipeline(task="text-generation", model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer, max\_length=200)  
result = pipe(f"<s>[INST] {prompt} [/INST]")  
print(result[0]['generated\_text'])
```
