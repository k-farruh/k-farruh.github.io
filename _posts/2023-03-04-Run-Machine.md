### Run Machine Learning Model on Alibaba Cloud with Docker

Previously, we prepared an ECS instance and Docker environment at the ECS instance [here](https://medium.com/@k-farruh/prepare-gpu-container-environment-on-alibaba-cloud-ecs-instance-1f16aef0654b) and [here](https://medium.com/@k-farruh/nvidia-tensorflow-docker-image-on-the-alibaba-cloud-ecs-part-2-b3476c19493c). Now it’s time to run the Machine Learning Model on Docker and get results. Let’s take on image classification tasks as an example. These tasks are well-studied and have a lot of benefits in terms of business values. Moreover, it is fundamental to attempt to comprehend an entire image.

Image classification categorizes and labels groups of pixels or vectors within an image based on specific rules within an image. The categorization law can be devised using one or more spectral or textural characteristics. Two general methods of classification are ‘supervised’ and ‘unsupervised.’ The goal is to classify the image by assigning it to a specific label. Typically, Image Classification deals with images in which only one object appears and being analyzed.
