### EasyDispatch: Using Generative AI and AnalyticDB for Enhanced Delivery Business Operations

Managing a delivery business can be challenging, with many tasks that require constant attention. From managing drivers to tracking deliveries, there are many aspects that need to be managed effectively to ensure customer satisfaction. In today’s digital age, customers expect quick and efficient service, and businesses need to keep up with the latest technologies to provide a seamless experience. Generative AI (GenAI) and vector database retrieval are two technologies that can be integrated with a delivery business to provide a personalized and efficient experience for customers. In this article, we will explore how integrating GenAI and vector database retrieval can bring benefits to a delivery business and provide use-cases where vector database retrieval can be used.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*iV43tNf9ZWvOXf55RTd7Jg.png)### What is Generative AI?

Generative AI refers to a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that is designed to generate new and original content, such as images, videos, text, and music, without human intervention. It involves using deep learning algorithms and neural networks to learn patterns and rules from large datasets and then generate new content based on this learned knowledge. Generative AI can be used in various fields, including art, music, gaming, and marketing. It has the potential to revolutionize the creative industry by enabling machines to create innovative and original content on their own.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*hIElbsN6fmvJbO1bM8MdnA.png)### What is LLM?

A large language model (LLM) is a type of AI model that is trained on vast amounts of text data to generate human-like language. It uses deep learning techniques to learn the statistical patterns and relationships between words, phrases, and sentences in a given language.

LLMs can be used for a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as text completion, text classification, sentiment analysis, and language translation. They work by breaking down text into smaller units, such as words or characters, and analyzing the relationships between them.

Large language models have many applications in areas such as chatbots, content generation, and language translation, and are likely to become increasingly important in the field of AI as the demand for more advanced NLP solutions grows.

### What is Vector Database Retrieval?

Vector database retrieval is a technology that uses mathematical algorithms to retrieve information from a database. It uses a vector space model to represent data in a multi-dimensional space, where each dimension corresponds to a unique feature of the data. Vector database retrieval enables businesses to retrieve information from large databases quickly and accurately.

### AnalyticDB Retrieve Plugin

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*0KNc5FFIZrbth-BWKnVA3w.png)Here is a step-by-step explanation of how the LLM Retrieve Plugin overall architecture with the example of EasyDispatch on how solving the problem of delivering a parcel:

1. The chat history shows that the user is interested in delivering a parcel, and the LLM Retrieve Plugin is designed to help with any tasks, here example of delivery parcel.

2. The plugin is integrated with LLMs like Tongyi/ChatGLM/Dolly2/ChatGPT and has access to the original documents through AnalyticDB.

3. The first phase of the plugin involves creating embeddings, which involves splitting and dicing the text and creating vectors that represent the different chunks of text. This is done using an embedding tool.

4. In the second phase of the plugin, the retrieve server uses vector search to find the most relevant information in the database. This involves searching for vectors that are closest to the user’s query and using similarity to measure the distance between them.

5. The plugin then uses vector write to return the relevant information to LLM. This information includes the time and address for pickup and delivery, which are essential for delivering the parcel.

6. The plugin also uses related knowledge about logistics, such as the importance of timely delivery and the need to provide accurate pickup and delivery addresses, to provide more comprehensive answers to the user’s questions.

7. In the second part of Phase 2, the plugin uses inference solving to provide a final outcome to the user. This involves combining all the relevant information and answering the user’s question about the time and address for delivery.

The Open Source LLM Retrieve Plugin is a powerful tool that uses open source embedding and vector search technology to help with logistic tasks like delivering parcels. It is able to provide accurate and relevant information by searching through a database of logistics information and using related knowledge to provide comprehensive answers to the user’s questions.

### What is EasyDispatch?

EasyDispatch is a big data and AI-powered logistics management platform developed by Alibaba Cloud. It enables businesses to optimize their logistics operations by providing real-time tracking and analysis, intelligent dispatching, and predictive maintenance capabilities. The platform uses advanced algorithms to optimize delivery routes, minimize transportation costs, and improve overall efficiency.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*YLoO7J9Xi7QS9hg0pk-xHw.png)### Integragration LLM to EasyDispatch

It is possible for EasyDispatch to use vector retrieval and LLM technology, as Alibaba Cloud offers a range of AI and big data services for its customers. Vector retrieval is a technique for retrieving similar items from large sets of data based on their mathematical representation as vectors, while large language models are deep learning models trained on vast amounts of text data to generate human-like language.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*oM6AqavAqF5smvubAVF57A.png)By incorporating these technologies, EasyDispatch could potentially enhance its capabilities in areas such as predicting delivery times, optimizing routing efficiency, and improving customer service through natural language processing and sentiment analysis. However, it ultimately depends on how Alibaba Cloud chooses to implement these technologies within the EasyDispatch platform.

EasyDispatch AnalyticDB LLM Cache Saving is a feature that allows users to save cache in AnalyticDB’s large-scale data warehousing system, making data retrieval faster and more efficient. Here’s how it works step by step:

1. A user enters a standalone question into the chatbot UI, which triggers the LLM to generate an answer.

2. The LLM uses an embedding generator to create a vector representation of the user’s question.

3. The vector representation of the user’s question is used to search the AnalyticDB vector database for similar vectors that represent knowledge related to the question.

4. The system retrieves the knowledge vectors and saves the question and answer pair, along with the embedding vector, to the cache store table in the cache saving server.

5. The LLM then generates an answer to the user’s question based on the retrieved knowledge and presents it in the chatbot UI.

6. If the similarity between the user’s question and a question in the cache is greater than 0.95, the cache is hit, and the system returns the answer from the cache-store table, rather than going through the entire process again.

7. If the cache is not hit, the system repeats steps 2–5 to generate a new answer and update the cache.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Qab9r6s_Th8101DpQeZGtg.png)By using a cache store, the system can quickly retrieve previously generated answers if the user asks a similar question. This reduces the processing load on the system and provides faster response times to users. The use of vector embeddings and the AnalyticDB vector database allows the system to find relevant knowledge for a given question quickly, making the LLM more accurate and efficient.

### Overall Architecture of EasyDispatch with AnalyticDB and LLM

EasyDispatch is a logistics management platform developed by Alibaba Cloud that uses big data and AI to optimize logistics operations. One of its features is the ability to connect to AnalyticDB, Alibaba Cloud Object Storage Service (OSS), and LLMs to automate and streamline logistics processes (details [here](https://medium.com/@k-farruh/next-level-conversations-llm-vectordb-with-alibaba-cloud-customizable-and-cost-efficient-1936a6bf2629)).

In this integration, the EasyDispatch server connects to AnalyticDB and other Alibaba Cloud services, such as OSS and LLM. The LLM is used to provide natural language processing capabilities to EasyDispatch, allowing users to interact with the platform through text-based commands.

Using the LLM, users can create orders, jobs, workers, and items, as well as add depots and locations to the EasyDispatch system. The LLM runs tasks based on EasyDispatch documentation and input files’ location, automatically processing user requests and generating appropriate actions within the system.

For example, a user could send a text command such as “Add a new worker to the system with the name John Smith and assign him to a job in location X.” The LLM would parse this command and create the new worker in the EasyDispatch system, assign them to the specified job, and update the system accordingly.

By integrating EasyDispatch with LLM technology, the platform becomes more user-friendly and accessible, allowing users to interact with the system through natural language commands and automating many of the manual tasks required in logistics management.
