### Compute Nest: Enabling Cutting-Edge Generative AI Integration and Knowledge Base Systems in Collaboration with Alibaba Cloud

[Compute Nest](https://www.alibabacloud.com/product/compute-nest?spm=a3c0i.27899667.6791778070.132.140a3398E8c8VK) is a comprehensive cloud integration Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) solution designed for Independent Software Vendors (ISVs), Systems Integrators (SIs), and Managed Service Providers (MSPs) to integrate their products and services with Alibaba Cloud seamlessly. With its unified service category and management platform, Compute Nest simplifies service integration and management, making it easier for service providers to deliver their offerings on Alibaba Cloud.

The Compute Nest infrastructure encompasses various components and features that enable smooth collaboration between service providers and Alibaba Cloud. These include secure connection, platform and data integration (User Access, RAM Access, API Access), account service, resource orchestration, license management, operation orchestration, API management, migration service, billing service, elastic orchestration, auditing, monitoring, and log management. By leveraging these capabilities, service providers can streamline their operations and offer a seamless user experience to their customers.

The collaboration between Alibaba Cloud and Compute Nest opens up several joint solutions and technical integration opportunities. This collaboration extends to both online and offline channels, allowing ISVs to directly integrate their solutions with Alibaba Cloud or distribute them through Alibaba Cloud Marketplace. This partnership enables ISVs to bring their solutions to a wider audience and provides them with access to Alibaba Cloud’s vast customer base and distribution channels.

In the first scenario, Private Deployment, service providers can simplify operations and maintenance and also earn additional revenues by reselling Alibaba Cloud products. This model provides service providers with the flexibility to customize and tailor their offerings to meet the specific requirements of their customers.

Another scenario, Fully Managed (Single Tenant), offers a cost-effective solution for service providers. By leveraging Alibaba Cloud’s infrastructure, service providers can deliver fully managed services to their customers, ensuring simplified operations and maintenance. This model enables accurate cost management per tenant, allowing service providers to optimize resource allocation and deliver cost-effective solutions to their customers.

This model allows service providers to consolidate their resources and efficiently manage multiple customers on a shared infrastructure, resulting in increased efficiency and cost savings.

To create a service on Compute Nest, ISVs or MSPs can publish their service and upload [Resource Orchestration Service (ROS)](https://www.alibabacloud.com/product/ros?spm=a2c63.p38356.6791778070.583.4ea57a5albWbVm) or Terraform templates for quick provisioning. End users can then subscribe to the service through the Alibaba Cloud Marketplace. With the end user’s agreement, service providers gain privileged access to the end user’s environment, enabling them to provide additional operation and maintenance support. This collaboration ensures that customers receive seamless service delivery and support from both the service provider and Alibaba Cloud.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*thOk1ZK9wFZ3WMDg.jpg)Alibaba Cloud offers a comprehensive suite of cloud services to customers worldwide. These services encompass various domains, including Elastic Computing Services (ECS), databases, networking, security management, application services, big data analytics, machine learning, and IoT services. By leveraging Alibaba Cloud’s services, users can access highly durable storage, efficient computing capabilities, high-performance databases, intelligent analytical tools, and more. The pay-as-you-go pricing model allows users to pay only for the resources they consume, helping enterprises lower their IT costs and scale their operations as needed.
