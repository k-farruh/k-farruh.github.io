K**ubernetes** is an open-source container-orchestration system that enables teams to deploy, scale, and manage containerized applications. It handles the scheduling of containers in a cluster and manages workloads so that everything runs as intended.

Enterprise businesses have been rapidly adopting the cloud and various cloud services to modernize their workloads and increase their agility and scalability. Through concepts like containerization and orchestration, companies have found ways to make applications more portable, increase efficiency and address challenges surrounding code deployment.

Alibaba Cloud, the global leader in cloud computing, offers various cloud services, including **A**libaba Cloud **C**ontainer Service for **K**ubernetes (ACK), a fully managed Kubernetes service.

We were running Kubernetes on Alibaba infrastructure before ACK was once a challenge due to several manual configurations which required extensive operational expertise and effort. Now, ACK can be used for various use cases, including machine learning/big data/web applications and others. After the ACK was successfully tested internally, have decided to make as a cloud-native product on Alibaba Cloud.
