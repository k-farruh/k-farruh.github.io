### Ethical Rules vs AI

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*_avUMW9PbkOMERI1HeZjxg.jpeg)Ethical Rules vs AIArtificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to help solve some of the world’s most intractable international development problems. From assisting farmers in adapting to climate change to predicting disease outbreaks to making congested urban centers more livable, international development implementers have begun turning to AI for more effective solutions. With this potential, however, comes the possibility for abuse, misuse, and unintended consequences.

AI systems are powerful analytical tools. Without proper consideration of the ethical risks, they can harm the very communities they are designed to help.

The possibility of creating thinking machines raises a host of ethical issues. These questions relate to ensuring that such devices do not harm humans and other morally relevant beings and to the devices themselves’ moral status. The first section discusses issues that may arise soon of AI. The second section outlines challenges for ensuring that AI operates safely as it approaches humans in its intelligence. The third section summarizes how we might assess whether, and in what circumstances, AIs themselves have moral status. In the fourth section, we consider how AIs might differ from humans in certain fundamental respects relevant to our ethical assessment of them. The final section addresses creating AIs more intelligent than humans and ensuring that they use their advanced intelligence for good rather than ill.

Responsibility, transparency, the possibility of checking, incorruptibility, predictability, and a tendency to not make innocent victims scream with helpless frustration:

* All criteria apply to humans performing social functions.
* All requirements must be considered in an algorithm intended to replace the human judgment of social roles.
* All conditions that may not appear in a machine learning journal considering how an algorithm scales up to more computers.

This list of criteria is by no means exhaustive, but it serves as a small sample of what an increasingly computerized society should be thinking about.
