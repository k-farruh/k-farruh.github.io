### Next-Level Conversations: LLM+VectorDB with Alibaba Cloud, Customizable and Cost-Efficient

We recommend using ECS for the backend and front end. If the user will use open-source, the LLM (Large Language Model) can be used GPU-ECS or Platform for AI (Artificial Intelligence). This tutorial will not cover the LLM part; we assume the user has LLM and its API key. The data will be saved in Analytic DB PostgreSQL (ADBPG), below high-level architecture.
