### Stochastic Gradient Descent as Driver of the AI

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/0*cbFtgsFgVnngjVX6.jpeg)hiking to downhill == gradient descentWe can imagine the world of gradient descent as a huge hill and process of gradient descent when the human is walking downhill. Here, the human needs to find the shortest way and need to choose the excellent slope (in case of gradient descent, the step alpha) to omit to fall down and not go on the flat area. Without slope, probably man can’t reach the down part of the hill.
